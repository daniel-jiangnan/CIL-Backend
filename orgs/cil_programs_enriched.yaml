          The Voice Options Program
          The Voice Options Program offers eligible Californians who are unable to speak,
          or who have difficulty speaking, with a free speech-generating device. The goal
          of this program is to ensure full and equal telephone communications access for all
          Californians with disabilities. When it comes to choosing a speech-generating application,
          it is imperative to select one that highlights your strengths, skills, and fully meets your
          needs without leaving you feeling restricted. Through this program, any eligible Californian
          referred to a Voice Options provider will have the opportunity to test five different speech
          generating applications for up to 14 days.

          We are happy to help you compare their chairs to the competition and test ride other brands
          if we have any in our collection of donated devices at the time of your visit.

          CIL also is a licensed vendor of Whill brand powerchairs, because we are impressed with the
          design, build quality, and customer service of this brand’s powerchairs.

          Our first priority is helping you find the best device to fit your goals — not making sales!
          If the best for you happens to be a Whill product, we’re happy to sell it to you if we are who
          you’d like to purchase from.

          Or we can help you look online for alternatives!

          maintains a widely used hub of PAS knowledge and best practices drawn from community
          experience.

          Finding and keeping attendants can be challenging and emotionally difficult, especially
          during times of crisis. While CIL does not hire attendants directly, staff provide tools,
          support, information, and strategies to help consumers build sustainable care networks.

          Service Goals:
          - Learn how and where to find personal attendants
          - Gain skills in interviewing and selecting compatible support staff
          - Build communication strategies for care work relationships
          - Organize and maintain effective care schedules

          CIL may coordinate with case managers (with consent) to support stronger continuity of care.

          Center for Independent Living (CIL) assists people with disabilities in obtaining resources
          and services needed in order to be able to remain living in the community instead of in
          institutions. We also assist people who are currently residing in institutions (such as nursing
          facilities, congregate care facilities, and mental health hospitals) who want to transition out
          of facilities and back to living independently in the community.

          More recently, CIL has also been focusing on diversion and transition support involving:
          - Foster care transitions
          - Reentry from incarceration
          - Avoiding homelessness / supporting unhoused youth and adults

          CIL provides support in developing transition and diversion plans, and through partnership
          with the CA Department of Rehabilitation, can provide funding (when available) to support
          implementing those plans.

          CIL conducts outreach in facilities and across community and government partner networks to
          identify people in need of diversion or transition support.

          CIL collaborates with individuals, families, caregivers, and partners before, during, and after
          diversion and transitions to advocate for and uphold independence and community living over
          institutionalization.

          How will I get out of my house safely during an evacuation warning? Where are my back-up
          medications? Who will I call to let them know I’m safe after a disaster? How do I run my
          CPAP machine and charge my wheelchair during a power outage? Will my Service Animal be okay
          during an emergency?

          All of these questions and more can be really important parts to your individual/household
          emergency plan. As a Listos Partner and Disability Disaster Access and Resources Center
          (DDARC), CIL offers 1-on-1 Emergency and Resiliency Planning for cross-disability communities
          and older adults in order to increase individual readiness in times of disaster or power shut-offs.

          1-on-1 Emergency and Resiliency Planning is a person-centered process that takes into account
          each person’s identities, location, access needs, and unique resources, and is peer-led,
          meaning it’s emergency planning by people with disabilities, alongside people with disabilities.

          CIL also has starter emergency kits for our communities to kickstart their emergency preparedness
          journey! We can help you plan and strategize what to put in your kit to keep you and your family
          safe and ready.

          Interested in getting started on your own? You can begin creating your plan today!

          CIL is a Disability Disaster Access and Resources Center (DDARC), thanks to partnership from
          the California Foundation of Independent Living Centers and PG&E. The purpose of a DDARC is
          to support people with disabilities and older adults before, during, and after Public Safety
          Power Shut Offs (PSPS) and disasters, such as wildfires, heatwaves, earthquakes, and more,
          and to ensure our communities can meet their medical, safety, and resiliency needs.

          As a DDARC, CIL provides:
          - 1-on-1 individual emergency planning
          - Support with signing up for critical alert programs such as Alameda County Alerts, Medical Baseline, and PSPS Alerts
          - Distribution of critical resources and accommodations during power outages, wildfires, and severe weather
          - Backup batteries and supplies for consumers who rely on powered medical equipment

          What is a Public Safety Power Shut-Off (PSPS)?
          A PSPS occurs when PG&E turns off power to reduce wildfire risk during severe weather.
          PG&E issues multiple alerts before, during, and after a PSPS event, including “power is off,”
          “weather all clear,” and “power restored” notifications.

          Consumers enrolled in the Medical Baseline program may receive additional alerts, including
          direct calls or doorbell notifications to ensure awareness before a PSPS event.

          The Codestars coding course is a virtual coding-centric workshop designed specifically for
          students on the spectrum and with other disabilities. We believe that everyone can learn to code
          and create amazing things with technology, regardless of their abilities or challenges. Our
          classes are tailored to meet the unique needs and learning styles of our students, providing a
          supportive and inclusive environment where they can thrive.

          Throughout the series, students will learn the fundamental concepts and skills of web design
          and python programming. They will start by designing and building their own websites using
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then move on to more advanced topics such as responsive
          design, user experience, and web accessibility. In the python classes, students will learn how to
          write code that can solve problems, automate tasks, and interact with data and other programs.
          They will also have the opportunity to work on projects that allow them to apply their new skills
          and creativity.
